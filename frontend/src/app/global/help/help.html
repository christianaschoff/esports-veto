    <h3>How does the veto process work</h3>
    <p>
        A veto process has (two) three major steps:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creation</li>
            <li>Veto</li>
            <li>Observing</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Creation</h4>
    <p>Creating a new veto is simple: click on "New" in the topbar, select your game and then decide what kind of veto system you want to use.
        <br />To give you an example:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pick the Game "StarCraft2".</li>
            <li>On the next page you must decide, if it is a 1v1 up to a 4v4 game.</li>
            <li>Then you must decide if it is a Best Of 1 up to a Best of 7.</li>
            <li>Finally you must decide the veto system (ABBA or ABAB).</li>
        </ul>    
    <p>
        Congratulations! You provided all information needed to start a new veto process.
        <br />We strongly recommend to provide player names to enhance the user experience significantly.
        <br />By pressing "CREATE VETO PROCESS" a new process is startet.        
    </p>
    <div class="important">Important</div>
    <p>You will see four QR-Codes/links after creation.
        <br />These links must be used by the players.
        <br />Send them the QR-Code or link.
        <br /><strong>Do not lose them, since they can not be recovered!</strong>
    </p>
    <h4>Veto</h4>
    <p>The veto process is quite easy. Both players must join the session by using their link.
        <br />When both players are present, the veto process can begin.
        <br />Depending on the chosen veto system the players vote one after another until all maps are picked/baned.        
    </p>

    <h4>Observing</h4>
    <p>All persons with the oberserver link can see the veto (-process). With this link you can also replay the veto process and 
        integrate it into E-Sports coverage/streams etc.</p>
    <p>
        There are multiple settings to tailor your observation experience to your needs. 
        <br />You can access the settings via the symbol <mat-icon inline>settings</mat-icon>                  
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a couple of shortcuts you can use via keyboard:
